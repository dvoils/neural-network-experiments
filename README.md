# [Convolutional Neural Networks for Autoencoders](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13IDnHLCjUqUsRwp64eew9oX5cwWym08m#scrollTo=IQ3gI-z-XdF4)
This notebook demonstrates how to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) autoencoder to denoise images. It trains a CNN to remove noise from MNIST handwritten digit images, showcasing the process of encoding, decoding, and minimizing the difference between the original and reconstructed images. The results are visualized by comparing original, noisy, and denoised images.
