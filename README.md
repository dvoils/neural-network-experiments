# [Arrival and Service Rates in Queues](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/dvoils/79f70b73f2374d4d6c3abbe4169027d8/arrival-and-service.ipynb)
This notebook uses the exponential distribution to model and simulate queueing systems. It explores arrival and service rates, their impact on stability, and the probability of waiting times. Python simulations and visualizations demonstrate queue behavior and the memoryless property of this distribution.
