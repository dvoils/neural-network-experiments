# Convolutional Neural Networks for Autoencoders
Demonstrate how to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) autoencoder to denoise images. It trains a CNN to remove noise from MNIST handwritten digit images and demonstrates encoding, decoding, and minimizing the difference between the original and reconstructed images. The results are visualized by comparing original, noisy, and denoised images.

# Arrival and Service Rates in Queues
Using the exponential distribution to model and simulate queueing systems. It explores arrival and service rates, their impact on stability, and the probability of waiting times. Python simulations and visualizations demonstrate queue behavior and the memoryless property of this distribution.
