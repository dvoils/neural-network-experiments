This delay arises because the A-type current initially activates and counteracts the depolarizing input, and only after its inactivation variable decays sufficiently does the membrane potential rise to threshold, allowing the neuron to fire.\n",

        "Low-threshold calcium currents contribute additional complexity to neuronal signaling. These calcium channels allow the passage of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ ions and are described not by conductance, but by permeability. The current is a function of the maximal permeability $\\bar{p}_\\text{Ca}$, and is modulated by activation $m$ and inactivation $h$ gating variables. Unlike sodium and potassium ions, calcium ions exist in much lower concentrations inside the cell. The resulting steep concentration gradient means that even small changes in channel opening can lead to significant influxes of $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. The intracellular calcium concentration $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]_i$ is therefore highly sensitive to current flow, introducing the potential for feedback mechanisms within the neuron.\n",

Although the text does not yet present a complete ODE formulation for calcium dynamics or the GHK current equation, these descriptions prepare the groundwork for models that include calcium influx and regulation. Once explicit mathematical expressions are introduced, these currents can be simulated alongside sodium and potassium channels in a unified model."

        "\n",
        "The T-type calcium current $I_T$ is an **inactivating current**, meaning that after the membrane depolarizes, the channel closes and the current fades. This is governed by the inactivation gating variable $h$, which typically drops to zero near resting potential due to prior activity. Notably, $I_T$ is distinct from the fast sodium current of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Whereas sodium channels are inactivated at rest because their activation gate $m$ is near zero, T-type calcium channels are inactivated because their inactivation gate $h$ is near zero. This key difference makes the T-type current dependent on **prior hyperpolarization** for recovery.\n",

        "## Postinhibitory Rebound\n",
        "\n",
        "A particularly important functional consequence of $I_T$ is its role in **postinhibitory rebound**. This phenomenon occurs when a neuron that has been hyperpolarized (e.g., by an inhibitory synaptic input) suddenly depolarizes and fires an action potential after the inhibition ends. The hyperpolarization **removes inactivation** of the T-type calcium channels by increasing $h$, and once the inhibition lifts, the channels can briefly open, allowing calcium influx that triggers a spike.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, this behavior is captured by the interplay of gating variables in the GHK current. After hyperpolarization, $h$ increases gradually; upon return to a more depolarized potential, $m$ quickly activates while $h$ is still elevated, leading to a transient inward current that depolarizes the membrane to threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "The time course of this rebound response depends heavily on the inactivation time constant of $h$. A long time constant means the T-type channels remain available just long enough to produce the rebound depolarization before inactivating again.\n"
