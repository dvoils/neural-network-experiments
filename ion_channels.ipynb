        "The classic **Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model** describes spike generation in the squid giant axon using **sodium** and **potassium** channels. In that model:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A brief influx of **sodium ions** triggers the action potential (spike).\n",
        "* An efflux of **potassium ions** follows, repolarizing the membrane.\n",
        "\n",
        "This basic mechanism (fast Na$^+$ influx followed by K$^+$ efflux) underlies spike generation across many organisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, **cortical neurons** in vertebrates have **many more types of ion channels**, leading to more diverse and complex electrophysiological behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Membrane Potential\n",
        "\n",
        "The following describes the dynamics of membrane potential $u(t)$:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "C \\frac{d}{dt} u(t) = I_{syn}(t) + \\sum_k I_k(t)\n",

        "where:\n",
        "\n",
        "* $C$ is membrane capacitance.\n",
        "* $I_{syn}(t)$ is the synaptic input current (current from synapses).\n",
        "* $I_k(t)$ are currents from various ion channels.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, this equation says: the rate of change of membrane voltage depends on the net current flowing into the neuron.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Ionic Current\n",
        "\n",
        "The ionic current through a specific channel $k$ is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",

        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "\n",
        "* $\\bar{g}_k$ is the maximum conductance of the channel.\n",
        "* $m$ and $h$ are gating variables representing activation and inactivation.\n",
        "* $p_k$ and $q_k$ are exponents describing how the gating variables contribute to channel conductance (typically from empirical fits).\n",
        "* $E_k$ is the reversal potential (where there is no net current flow).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the original HH model, for potassium, typically $p_k = 4$ and $q_k = 0$, meaning inactivation ($h$) is omitted.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the HH model is a solid foundation (with two channel types), real neurons have **many different channels**—hence the term “zoo of ion channels.” The subsequent sections delve into various channel types, starting with sodium channels.\n"
