        "A **Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO)** is one of the most fundamental models in classical mechanics. It describes systems in which the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium and acts in the opposite direction. Common physical examples include a mass attached to a spring and small-angle pendulum oscillations.\n",

        "According to Newton’s second law, the net force acting on a mass is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration. For a spring obeying Hooke’s law, the restoring force is given by $F = -kx$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium. Applying Newton’s law:\n",
